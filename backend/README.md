# Backend Development Steps

### **Step 1: Set up your project**
- Initialize the backend project by setting up a Node.js environment.
- Install essential packages like `express` for the server and `mongoose` for database integration.
- Configure a basic project structure, such as `routes`, `models`, and `controllers` folders.

---

### **Step 2: Initialize MongoDB**
- Set up a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- Create a database for the project, such as `paytm`.
- Verify the database connection is established successfully.

---

### **Step 3: Create a user schema**
- Design a schema for user details using Mongoose.
- Include basic fields like `name`, `email`, and `password`.
- Add necessary validations like required fields, email format, and password length.

---

### **Step 4: Build the signup endpoint**
- Create a POST endpoint to allow users to register.
- Save user details to the database after validation.
- Return a success message or error response based on the result.

---

### **Step 5: Hash passwords**
- Use a library like `bcrypt` to hash user passwords before storing them in the database.
- Ensure the hashing process is secure and efficient.
- Modify the signup process to include this hashing step.

---

### **Step 6: Create a login endpoint**
- Build a POST endpoint for users to log in.
- Authenticate users by comparing entered passwords with hashed passwords in the database.
- Generate a token or session if login is successful.

---

### **Step 7: Protect routes using middleware**
- Add middleware to verify user tokens or sessions for protected routes.
- Ensure that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive endpoints.

---

### **Step 8: Implement user-specific endpoints**
- Create basic endpoints for user-specific operations, such as viewing profile details.
- Use middleware to ensure only authenticated users can access these endpoints.

---

### **Step 9: Create an account schema**
- Design a separate schema for account details, such as account balance and account ID.
- Link this schema to the user schema using references or embedded documents.

---

### **Step 10: Transactions in databases**
- Ensure transactions involving account balances are atomic (either fully completed or rolled back in case of failure).
- Handle scenarios like transferring funds between accounts, ensuring no data inconsistency occurs.

---

### **Step 11: Initialize balances on signup**
- Update the signup process to assign users a random initial account balance between 1 and 10,000.
- Ensure this is done programmatically without external dependencies.

---

### **Step 12: Create a new router for accounts**
- Set up a separate Express router to handle all account-related endpoints.
- Route requests to this new router using a base path like `/api/v1/account`.

---

### **Step 13: Implement balance and transfer endpoints**
1. **Get balance**:
   - Create a GET endpoint to fetch the current account balance of a user.
   - Authenticate users before fetching their account details.

2. **Make a transfer**:
   - Create a POST endpoint to transfer money from one account to another.
   - Validate input, such as transfer amount and account IDs.
   - Update balances atomically to avoid inconsistencies.

---

### **Step 14: Checkpoint and test the solution**
- Verify all implemented features are working as expected using Postman or a similar tool.
- Test the following scenarios:
  1. Signup and login.
  2. Retrieve balance for a user account.
  3. Transfer money between accounts.
  4. Check updated balances after the transfer.
- Ensure MongoDB has the following collections:
  1. `paytm.users` – Stores user information.
  2. `paytm.accounts` – Stores account-related details.
